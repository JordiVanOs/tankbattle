The new High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) of Unity has decal support integrated into it by default.
However, the HDRP can be acquired by enabling "preview packages" in the package manager, and installing "Render-pipelines.high-definition"
You can read up on the HDRP at https://blogs.unity3d.com/2018/09/24/the-high-definition-render-pipeline-getting-started-guide-for-artists/

Decals use the HDRP/Decal shader: https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ScriptableRenderPipeline/wiki/Decal-Projector
